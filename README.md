Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. 

## 🚀 Quick start

1. Deploy to Netlify

    [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/oberionio/gatsby-starter-oberion-16bit)

2. Set Steam URL

Two possibilities:

1. Create an environment variable `STEAM_URL` in Netlify. 
  
   Set your preferred Steam game with a URL to Steam such as `https://store.steampowered.com/app/815490/Chainmonsters`

2. Set an URL directly in `gatsby-config-js`:
```
const STEAM_URL = process.env.STEAM_URL || "https://store.steampowered.com/app/815490/Chainmonsters";
// If no STEAM_URL is set as a Netlify environment variable 
// "https://store.steampowered.com/app/815490/Chainmonsters" will be used as default
```
